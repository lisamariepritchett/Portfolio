This portfolio contains some of my Computational Neuroscience and Data Science coding work. 

PNAS2015 contains all data, code, and result output for my 2015 publication in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. I worked with my supervisor and coauthor Richard Murray for all of the analysis. For a full description of the project, the PNAS published article is included as 2015.pnas. All other files are described in the README file inside PNAS2015 folder.
